in this code, I have analyzed salary discrepancies by role.

Mainly focusing on the Annual Salaries column, these are the steps I followed:-

1. Data cleaning -

 The salaries in the column initially took the format $123,456. This value has two non-numeric characters, the comma (,) and the dollar sign ($), started off by removing the non-numeric characters.

 The next step was to change the values to an integer because they are strings.
